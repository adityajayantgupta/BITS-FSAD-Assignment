0,Apple-Cranberry Crostada,,,,8,6 to 8 - servings,"3 tablespoons butter, 2 pounds Granny Smith apples (or other firm, crisp apples), peeled, quartered, cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick, 1 pound Macintosh apples (or other soft-textured apples that fall apart when cooked), peeled, quartered, cored, and sliced 1/4-inch thick, ½ cup sugar, ½ cup dried cranberries, 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed but still cold (follow package directions), 1  egg white, lightly beaten, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 cup Optional: Ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream","Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add apples, 1/2 cup sugar and cranberries; cover and cook until apples release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until soft apples fall apart and juices thicken to a thin-syrup consistency, about 5 minutes longer. Pour onto a large-lipped cookie sheet or jellyroll pan and cool to room temperature. (Can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 5 days.)
Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Open puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a rectangle, about 10 by 16 inches. Transfer to a large cookie sheet. (I suggest lining the sheet with parchment paper; this ensures the crostada doesn't stick and allows easy cleanup.)
Spread cooked apples over pastry, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold up pastry borders over apples. Unfold corners and form ruffled creases to keep dough from overlapping. Brush pastry border with egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 Tb. sugar. Bake until pastry is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature with optional ice cream or whipped cream.",4.4,https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/76931/apple-cranberry-crostada/,/Desserts/Fruit Desserts/Apple Dessert Recipes/,"Total Fat 18g 23%, Saturated Fat 7g 34%, Cholesterol 19mg 6%, Sodium 128mg 6%, Total Carbohydrate 60g 22%, Dietary Fiber 5g 16%, Total Sugars 40g, Protein 4g, Vitamin C 8mg 42%, Calcium 35mg 3%, Iron 1mg 6%, Potassium 245mg 5%","Servings: 8, Yield: 6 to 8 - servings",https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/Tf1wH73bfH6OqlfQySSDtMaP-nw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/517708-5f57072dedb04a389edab3e141517d4d.jpg
